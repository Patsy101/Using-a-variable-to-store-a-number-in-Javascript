# Using-a-variable-to-store-a-number-in-Javascript
Kia ora if you are reading this that means im on practice i usually study on a book and learn and i try to rewrite the code in Visual studio
for you to see my code i highly recommend you to copy and run it on visual studio as i am still finding it a bit hard to put it on a live website 
Thank you
